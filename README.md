## Dialogflow Intents

The concept of the chat is to have an agent named Emmy navigate the interface and answer user questions. This means that you can ask Emmy a variety of questions related to the website's features and she will respond with helpful information and guidance. She may answer if she likes coffee too.<br>
For instance, you could ask these questions.

- "How are you?"
- "What language do you speak?"
- "Where's your LinkedIn?"
- "Do you have LinkedIn?"
  <br>
  etc...
